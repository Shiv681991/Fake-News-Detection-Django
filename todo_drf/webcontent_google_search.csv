 The Delhi Congress had questioned how Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal was able to get his COVID-19 test result within 12 hours of submitting his sample when people were waiting several days for labs to give them their result. “I would like to ask Mr. Kejriwal that if he could get his test result in 12 hours then why does the “aam” citizen have to wait so long for a result. Do they not have the right to receive their result as soon as you did,” Delhi Congress Chief Anil Kumar had said. He also questioned how the CM’s sample was allowed to be collected for testing as according to the government’s rules, those with mild symptoms like fever and cough did not have to be tested. “Why is the CM promoting this VIP culture for himself instead of leading by example,” Mr. Kumar had said.
