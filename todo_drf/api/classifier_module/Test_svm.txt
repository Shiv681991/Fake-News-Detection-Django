Trump and his enablers dropped the ball, our nation has the most covid-19 case then anyone else, itâ€™s a shame. We went from being the best country to a third world country!  This is the biggest screw up in our nations history! Trump has all those Americans blood in his hand!
@SharpNetwork Great words if you ignore the context of his actions. His policies will make illegal immigrants of the very nurses he praises.  His response to covid-19 has increased the risk to those doctors and nurses. He voted against payrises for NHS staff. But great speech, that's the key
Quick question, if Clinton was impeached because he lied, why doesn't some one just ask Trump, under oath, how prepared we were to handle covid-19 and if we have enough PPE? There is PLENTY of evidence of him lying about it on camera.
