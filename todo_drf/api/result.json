Twoyearold Emile Ouamouno had been fond of playing inside the tree which was near his home in Meliandou \u2013 a village in the heart of the Guinean jungle But other life had also discovered its cosy confines bats Children would sometimes catch them there before roasting them for dinner Then Emile got sick On the 28 December 2013 he succumbed to a violent and mysterious illness His mother sister and grandmother were next And that was it \u2013 after the funeral the disease gradually began to spread By 23 March 2014 there had been \u2013 and scientists confirmed that it was Ebola Over the next three and a half years the world looked on in horror as the virus claimed more than 11325 lives But while this was going on another tragedy was unfolding The outbreak severely strained the resources of local healthcare services \u2013 workers died large numbers of hospitals closed and those that remained open were overwhelmed with tackling Ebola itself In the three most affected countries \u2013 Sierra Leone Liberia and Guinea \u2013 people began avoiding healthcare at all costs They were afraid of this mysterious new disease but they were also fearful of doctors With their and association with sudden death healthcare workers had become heavily stigmatised People didn \u2019 t want to go near them As a result a 2017 analysis found that the pandemic The number of pregnant women seeking help with childbirth was down by 80 vaccination rates plummeted and there were 40 fewer admissions of children with malaria Ironically after an intense international effort to combat the pandemic this collateral damage was more severe than the disease itself Over a million children and 56700 mothers are at risk from the sideeffects of the pandemic Credit Getty Images In 2020 the world risks watching a similar scenario unfold Early on many nations were keen to reassure the public about the ways Covid19 was being prioritised \u2013 beds and ventilators were ringfenced unproven treatments were stockpiled and doctors were reassigned to respiratory wards in their thousands In the UK the government pledged to provide everything the health service needed to cope with the pandemic \u201c Similar steps were taken in countries around the world as they fought to tackle the rising infection rates Anything considered nonurgent was delayed or cut back from certain surgeries to sexual health services stop smoking programmes mental health support dentistry vaccinations cancer screenings and routine checkups It turns out all these things are important \u2013 there \u2019 s no such thing as a \u201c spare \u201d doctor or superfluous medical discipline after all As a result this intense focus on a single foe has already had some harrowing sideeffects Across the globe patients have reported being with sometimes fatal results In the Balkans women have been driven to try themselves while experts in the UK have reported a rise in DIY dentistry as people turn to toecurling improvisations involving Panichoarding of the drug hydroxychloroquin which is normally used to treat malaria and autoimmune conditions and has recently been found to And as with all crises the current pandemic looks set to hit the poorest countries the hardest Scientists have warned that in some places disruption to the control of diseases such as could lead to losses on the same scale as those caused directly by the virus Similarly experts fear that deaths from illnesses such as cholera could Vaccinations are a particular concern The World Health Organization has calculated that at least 80 million children under the age of one are now at risk of after the pandemic disrupted programmes in at least 68 countries Polio is expected to make a comeback despite a which meant it was whose sole member is currently smallpox Meanwhile David Beasley executive director of the United Nations \u2019 World Food Programme warned last month that the world is teetering on the edge of a \u2013 with 130 million people at risk of starvation on top of the 135 million who are already on the brink Finally its thought that the global lockdowns and subsequent economic turmoil could increase socalled deaths of despair Polio is expected to make a comeback despite a multibillion dollar effort to make it extinct Credit Getty Images What is the true scale of the collateral damage caused by Covid19 \u2013 and what can we do to stop it For the epidemiologist Timothy Roberton together with colleagues from Johns Hopkins University Maryland the sideeffects of the pandemic became a concern almost as soon as it started \u201c A lot of us looked at the response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014 so we knew what might happen \u201d he says In particular the team was interested in how Covid19 could affect women and children in lowincome countries such as those in SubSaharan Africa They modelled the impact of several scenarios of increasing severity and identified two main ways that the response to Covid19 could increase the number of casualties One is through the disruption of health services \u201c So for example that might be because people are too afraid to seek help \u2013 the demand side \u201d says Roberton And then theres the supply side \u2013 health care workers might be sick themselves they might be diverted to work on the pandemic or there might be shortages of medicines \u201d Another looming problem is families not having access to enough food which can increase their susceptibility to infectious diseases In all the scientists predicted that in a worstcase scenario where the use of health services is reduced by up to 50 and malnourishment is boosted by the same amount as an indirect result of the pandemic Most of the child fatalities would be from pneumonia or dehydration due to diarrhoea while for the women they would probably be due to complications from pregnancy or childbirth \u2013 haemorrhages eclampsia and sepsis \u201c What we were looking at is if they don \u2019 t get treatment for these things \u2013 if children don \u2019 t get oral rehydration or mothers don \u2019 t get antibiotics \u201d says Roberton When these deaths are added to the number at risk from famines the toll really begins to add up The WFP is currently providing food to nearly 100 million people every single day \u2013 and of that number around 30 million depend on them for their very survival According to their analysis in the coming months if their ability to provide this normal support is disrupted That \u2019 s not including those who are newly impoverished by the pandemic itself \u201c If you look at the big picture the world thought it was doing pretty well and the numbers of hungry people in the world were coming down \u201d says Jane Howard who is head of communications at WFP She explains that in the last five years or so this trend has reversed \u2013 mostly as a result of conflict and climate change \u201c Just before the coronavirus crisis broke we got some new figures which really alarmed us \u2013 showing that the number of acutely hungry people had risen quite steeply \u201d Not only is the current pandemic likely to tip an extra 130 million people into nearstarvation but it also threatens the donations the programme relies upon \u201c If the world economy is hit and countries are not able to provide as much funding as they expect then you know you have a whole new scenario in your hands which is really quite scary \u201d says Howard Exactly how Covid19 will push people into famine is a little bit more complicated Howard explains that contrary to the stereotypical images of starving people from 90s charity films who might live in the remotest parts of SubSaharan Africa today malnourishment is also a big problem in cities \u2013 and this is where the pandemic is likely to hit people the hardest Some experts think that 60000 cancer patients could die in the UK alone as a result of delays in diagnosis and treatment Credit Science Photo Library \u201c If you live in a rural village you might have a vegetable plot or your aunt might have a cow that can give you meat \u201d she says \u201c Youve got a little bit of a cushion around you But in a city you are absolutely at the mercy of the prices in the market \u201d At the moment the major concern is for labourers rickshaw drivers and building workers For example one of Howard \u2019 s colleagues in The Republic of the Congo has already noticed that the cost of many basic foods near where he lives such as peanut paste and cassava flour has gone up by 10 in the last two weeks This is perhaps partly down to the fact that markets have restricted their opening hours but also because Covid19 has already started to affect global supply chains \u2013 and imports are already becoming more expensive And there are all kinds of other hidden costs For one woman the lack of public transport due to a lockdown meant she had to hire a wheelbarrow to bring her purchases home Of course there \u2019 s another reason many countries could experience more deaths from collateral damage rather than the virus itself \u2013 and It \u2019 s wellknown that Covid19 affects the elderly more but the degree to which this is true is staggering \u2013 according to New York City data from 13 May there had been in people aged 75 years and over compared to those up to 17 years old On the other hand lowincome countries tend to have more youthful populations In the youngest country in the world \u2013 Niger in West Africa \u2013 the median age is The nation also has the highest birth rate with each woman having 72 children in her lifetime So far they \u2019 ve reported 254 deaths from the current pandemic In contrast Italy has a median age which hovers around 45 as well as one of the highest tallies of fatalities from Covid19 with over 33000 deaths at this time The degree to which the pandemic is responsible for these fatalities is still under debate \u2013 it might be that there are fewer lifeyears lost to the virus directly than it seems For example while older people have the highest risk of dying from Covid19 they are also at the highest risk from other seasonal or respiratory diseases like norovirus or pneumonia At the moment there are still significantly more deaths each month than is normal for this time of year But if the total later drops below the average it \u2019 s possible that the virus has mostly been as rather than years In fact even in wealthy countries it \u2019 s thought that indirect deaths could eventually eclipse the number of direct ones in the long term The World Health Organization has estimated that at least 80 million children under the age of one are now at risk of diptheria polio and measles Credit EPA Take cancer Since the pandemic began much of the work that goes into reducing the burden of the disease and making it less fatal \u2013 from cervical smear tests to breast cancer screening \u2013 has been affected as the focus shifted to saving the lives of those at the most immediate risk For some people this will inevitably have fatal consequences \u201c Cancer can \u2019 t wait \u201d says Sara Hiom director of early diagnosis and cancer intelligence at Cancer Research UK a charity that funds scientific research into cancer \u201c Cancer will always be more easy to treat and cure the earlier it \u2019 s diagnosed \u201d Despite this she explains that numerous cancer screening programmes have been paused across the UK since the lockdowns began \u2013 meaning the 1600 cancer cases they would normally uncover each month are currently going undetected \u201c These are not sick people These are not people who we expect to have cancer But the purpose of the screening programs themselves is theyre part of our armoury to diagnose cancer early \u201d she says Another important tool is referrals from GPs but here there \u2019 s also a problem The data shows that people aren \u2019 t attending appointments at the moment possibly because they \u2019 re afraid to of leaving the house When they do make it referrals to specialists aren \u2019 t going ahead \u2013 For those who already have a diagnosis there might be a long delay before they are able to start treatment \u2013 and Hiom explains that when the pandemic begins to subside working through the backlog will be an extremely slow process In total one group of oncologists estimated that as a result of delays in diagnosis and treatment Finally there \u2019 s the issue of the impending recession which has already officially begun in Germany and is expected to be Like many other important health organisations Cancer Research is dependent on donations from the general public \u2013 and many of their most lucrative activities such as sponsored runs are currently offlimits This could A temporary stop to cancer screening programmes in many countries will mean thousands of cases going undiagnosed each month Credit Science Photo Library So what can be done to minimise the indirect consequences of Covid19 Hiom is keen to see cancer screening programmes restarted quickly but she is also hoping to get the message out that cancer must be dealt with as soon as possible \u2013 and hopes that patients will start to attend appointments again over the coming months \u201c Late stage cancers are far more complex involved and costly to treat in every sense of the word \u201d she says \u201c Costly to the patient costly to the NHS \u201d Howard meanwhile points to a checklist of things the WFP \u2019 s resident economist has come up with They range from helping governments to bring in safety nets for their populations \u2013 such as continuing to provide free school meals to children though the schools may be shut \u2013 to keeping supply chains working and avoiding trade barriers \u201c It can be small things that actually can have a big impact \u201d she says \u201c For example if you insist that international truck drivers have to go into quarantine your supply chain completely breaks down So in southern Africa weve been persuading governments to issue letters to certain contracted transporters guaranteeing their drivers \u2019 rights of passage \u201d"}]}]}
